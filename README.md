# Python-function-for-stochastic-modelling-of-interbedding
Interbedding is common in geology, it occurs when beds of a particular lithology lie between or alternate with beds of a different lithology. It often reflects a cyclical change in sedimentary conditions, e.g. sea level variations.
I developed this stochastic interbedding modelling function for generating multiple realizations of interbedded chalk and flint layers, in which the thickness of chalk layers bounded by flint bands varies laterally while the thickness of flint bands is constant. This function can be adapted to model other interbedding cases, such as the interbedding of limestone and marl layers, the interbedding of sandstone and shale layers.
User specified input parameters include: 2D model size and resolution, mean and standard deviation of the thickness distribution of lithology_1 (chalk in my case), and variogram range which describes the lateral variation of the thickness
The output is a 2D matrix with 0s indicating lithology_1(chalk in my case) and 1s indicating lithology_2(flint bands in my case)
